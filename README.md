# Place cell simulation

This repository generates **synthetic place cell data**, focusing on modeling spatial fields in a 1D linear track environment.  

## Motivation

Place cells, discovered in the hippocampus, are neurons that fire when an animal is in a specific location in an environment.  
Modeling them synthetically is useful for:
- Testing spatial decoding algorithms
- Validating analysis pipelines


## Repository structure
- `src/` : Python modules for dataset generation
- `examples/` : CLI example
- `notebooks/` : Jupyter notebooks for experiments
- `data/` : placeholder for generated data

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SaraMolas/place-cell-simulations.git
cd place-cell-simulations
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
